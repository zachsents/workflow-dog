## Fundamentally better automation

WorkflowDog takes a different approach to visual automation than most existing tools.

Most other tools have actions laid out chronologically, i.e. in the order they will be executed. To specify data flow, you have to use variables or other mechanisms to pass data between actions.

WorkflowDog, on the other hand, uses a _data-first_ approach. This means that the lines connecting actions in your automation "flowchart" represent the data that is being passed between from one to the next. The order of the actions is determined by whenever the data is ready to be passed to the next action.

**This is a powerful concept** because it means the building process is truly visual. You can see the data flow through your automation, and you can see exactly what data is being passed between each action.
