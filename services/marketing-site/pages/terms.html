            <h1>Terms of Service for WorkflowDog</h1>

            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 6, 2024</p>

            <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>

            <h2>3. Accounts</h2>
            <p>
                You must register for an account to access most of our services. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for all activities that occur under your account.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Communications</h2>
            <p>
                By creating an account, you agree to receive periodic product update emails from WorkflowDog.

            <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
            <p>
                You agree not to use our services for any unlawful or prohibited activities. You must not use our services to distribute malware, spam, or engage in activities that compromise the security of our services or others' privacy. Additionally, you must not abuse control flow patterns such as creating infinite loops which can misuse compute resources and impair service performance.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Service Plans</h2>
            <p>
                WorkflowDog offers different service plans, including free and paid options. Each plan has specific limits on usage as detailed on our pricing page (<a href="/#pricing">https://workflow.dog#pricing</a>). You must comply with the limits imposed by your chosen plan and not attempt to circumvent such limitations. Exceeding these limits may result in service throttling, suspension, or upgrade prompts, depending on the severity of
                the overuse.
